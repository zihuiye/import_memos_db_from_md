# import_memos_db_from_md
I used OneNote for a long time, but it's hard to use when number of notes getting larger because its bad searching mechanism. Its totally rubbish when searching Chinese terms. I decided to switch to memos and I had to find a way to migrate all my notes into memos platform.
